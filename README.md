# Docc v2.0.1
```
"Dem doccs doe"
  - Said no one ever, python docs suck
```

Use this, it is better than other garbage, why? Because it's simple, and it WORKS out of the box.

## Does it work well?
Probably.

## Usage:
```
usage: docc [-h] [--dir DIR] [--file FILE] [--excludes EXCLUDES]

Doc generators are shit, use this, it isn't.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --dir DIR            If you need to specify a spicy dir
  --file FILE          Specify a path to parse
  --excludes EXCLUDES  do,it,like,this,it,can,be,a,dir,or,a,file
```
